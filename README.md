## About

The game's name references Bitcoin's fixed supply cap of 21 million coins - the hardest money ever created. In a world where fiat currencies are constantly debased, you step into the shoes of Michael Saylor and embark on an epic journey across Digital Manhattan to stack as many satoshis as possible before they're all gone.

Battle against altcoin crypto villains and the Short Jim who want to stop your Bitcoin accumulation. Use your laser eyes (the ultimate symbol of Bitcoin conviction) to defeat enemies and protect your stack.

Whether you're a seasoned Bitcoiner or just discovering the world of sound money, 21 Million Race brings the excitement of the Bitcoin revolution to life in a fun, retro arcade experience. Stack sats, have fun, and remember: there will only ever be 21 million.
